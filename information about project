Machine Learning Major Project

Online Payments Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

Introduction

In this project, we aim to train a machine learning model that classifies online transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

A dataset from Kaggle is used, which contains historical records of online payments, balances, and fraud labels. By analyzing this dataset, we can understand which transactions are likely to be fraud.

Dataset Description

The dataset has the following columns:

1. step Unit of time (1 step = 1 hour).

2. type Type of online transaction (PAYMENT, CASH_OUT, TRANSFER, etc.).

3. amount Transaction amount.

4. nameOrig Customer initiating the transaction.

5. oldbalanceOrg Balance before the transaction.

6. newbalanceOrig Balance after the transaction.

7. name Dest Recipient of the transaction.

8. oldbalanceDest transaction. Recipient's balance before

9. newbalanceDest transaction. Recipient's balance after

10. isFraud Target column (1 = Fraud, 0 = Not Fraud).Methodology (Step by Step)


Step 1: Import Libraries

Python



import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import seaborn as sns

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.ensemble import Random ForestClassifier from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score, confusion_matrix


Step 2: Load Dataset



data pd.read_csv("fraud.csv")

print(data.head())

print(data.info())


Step 3: Data Preprocessing

Removed nameOrig and nameDest (not useful for prediction).

Converted type (categorical) into numeric values using one-hot encoding.

Checked for missing values.



data data.drop(['nameOrig', 'nameDest'], axis=1) data pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['type'],

drop_first=True)


Step 4: Feature Selection


X data.drop('isFraud', axis=1)

y data['isFraud']Step 5: Train-Test Split


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test =

train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3,

random_state=42)


Step 6: Model Training



model Random ForestClassifier(n_estimators=100,

random_state=42)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)


Step 7: Prediction



y_pred model.predict(X_test)


Step 8: Evaluation


print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

cm confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

sns.heatmap(cm, annot True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')

plt.xlabel("Predicted")

plt.ylabel("Actual")

plt.show()

Results

The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of ~99% on the test dataset.

Confusion matrix shows effective classification between fraud and non-fraud cases. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can detect fraudulent online payments. By using transaction details and balances, the model successfully classifies fraud with high accuracy.

This fraud detection system can help banks, payment gateways, and financial institutions minimize risks by flagging suspicious transactions for further investigation.
